LABELS:

Region      Hex Code    Label

Note: 
1. In some images, the distinction between 'Grass' and 'Trees' is not very clear and hence they are combined and marked as 'Trees'.
2. The marked color codes will be approx. to the above-shown color codes.
3. Image label color codes might differ a bit for set 3 images.
