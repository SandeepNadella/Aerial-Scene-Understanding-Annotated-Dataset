Note: 
1. In some images, the distinction between 'Grass' and 'Trees' is not very clear and hence they are combined and marked as 'Grass'.
2. The initial part of data set has part of van being marked as 'Sky' which must be masked to check accuracy of 'Sky'.

Disclaimer:
Although every care has been taken in preparing the dataset, yet it may not be error free. No responsibility/liability will be taken for any inaccuracy that might have crept in.
